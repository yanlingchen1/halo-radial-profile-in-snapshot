# xray sb halo profile
1. For every halo, calculate the xray flux for every particles in the cylinder.
- The xray flux of every particle is defined as $L_{part}/(4*\pi * d_L^2)$, where luminosity distance $d_L = z_coor * (1+redshift)$ 
- The cylinder center is halo's gas mass center. The cylinder length is 6.25 cMpc, defined as the same as Nastasha[1], the radius of the cylinder is
