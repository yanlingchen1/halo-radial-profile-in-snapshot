# halo-radial-profile-in-snapshot
## Data
Flamingo snapshots (L1000N1800)
## Usage 
- Plot halo radial profile for various properties of different halo mass bins.
- Plot halo L200c versus halo masses, and compared with Nastasha for sanity check.
## TO DO
1. same thickness as nastasha 6.25cMpc thick
2. same pixel size as nastasha? 3.125ckpc
3. cut median profile before dropping (implying not enough particles), while leave mean profiles. Criteria by Joey: Cut if 60% of the halos have 0 particles in this bin.
4. Develop calculate cylinder of the halos. 
5. Calculate for halo mass from 13-15.5
6. SB error: every particle should be divided by the square of its lum distance, in other words, z distance.
